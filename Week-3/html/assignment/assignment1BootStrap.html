             <p class="col-12">
                An active team player that has always strived for a complete and satisfying performance experience. 
                I have learned how to exceed expectations in a well organized team throughout my time in the military.                     I have accumulated many experiences that have tested me to better myself through every interaction 
                these benefits can be see through the way that I pride myself on my work, the way that I stay very vocal on my work or if I do not know my task. 
                I understand how one person can be the different from an easy day at work to a hectic day at work. 
                I have been passed down the tools of being a great team player from my time in the Marine Corps. 
                I have accumulated 4 years of customer service that have improved throughout my time in the working field. 
                I hope that I have given you a little insight on what I can bring to the company.
